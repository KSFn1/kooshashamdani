                    <p>Our world today is undeniably digital. New technologies,  from social media and GPS<br> systems to artificial intelligence and digital twins,  make the planet we inhabit unrecognizable<br> from even 20 years ago. If you're feeling queasy at the speed of change, hold tight. It's only<br> going to get faster and therefore, I believe that having some sort of a digital marketing place is<br> beneficial.</p>

                    <p>My name is Koosha Shamdani and I’m a fourteen year old who loves computers. Since I was<br> a little kid, I always enjoyed learning about computers in general. Whether it was messing<br> around with apps, testing different elements, or playing video games, I was always trying to find<br> a way to learn a new thing about computers. </p>

                    <p>I was first introduced to video editing by a friend of mine in 2020. My first projects were<br> mainly focused on video gaming content or, Fortnite montages to be precise. I use DaVinci<br> Resolve 17 as my video editing software and I've been using it since day one. I edited and<br> sold a few montages to clients that I found in discord servers. As I edited more and more<br> videos, I tried learning to edit other content as well. In January 2021, I started making short<br> advertising videos for fun. Although I have never published an advertising video, I<br> understand all the constituents that go into producing an effective video and I'm capable of<br> manufacturing it. </p>

                    <p>In October 2021, I started learning to build and maintain websites using JavaScript (HTML and<br> CSS). My first few projects were mainly basic, since I was focused on experiencing and learning how<br> things work rather than copying from a YouTube video. However, over time as I experienced more and more,<br> I’m now able to work with HTML and CSS to build and maintain websites that are written<br> in JavaScript. Overall, I have created seven functioning websites since I started and this current <br>website is one of them.</p>
